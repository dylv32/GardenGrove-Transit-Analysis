ðŸšŒ Garden Grove Transit Data Visualization
ðŸ“– Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes bus stop locations in the Garden Grove, California area using public transportation data in the GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) format.

It uses Python and Folium to:
-Load and clean GTFS data files (routes.txt, stops.txt, trips.txt, stop_times.txt)
-Filter bus stops within Garden Groveâ€™s latitude and longitude boundaries
-Generate an interactive HTML map showing all stops in the area
-Link stops to their routes and count how often each stop is served

ðŸ§  Key Insights
After analyzing the data:
-The Harbor Blvd corridor had the most frequent stops.
-Stops like HARBORâ€“EAST SHUTTLE AREA and 1STâ€“FAIRVIEW showed the highest visit frequency.
-These high-frequency stops suggest strong ridership demand and efficient route coverage.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
-Python 3.13+
-Pandas â€“ for data cleaning and analysis
-Folium â€“ for generating interactive maps
